Python code to learn Linear Regression from scratch. It give a very basics idea what going on inside a Linear Regression model. 
Data set used here is a 2D only i.e. it contain only one feature vector along with output. 
Data set is generated using linear X depependent reelation with random number and store in cvs file (data.csv)
To run linear_regression.py, keep data.csv file in same folder as linear_regression.py or put the file path
**The specility of code is that it can animate first 10 step of regression. **
