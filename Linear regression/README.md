Python code to learn Linear Regression from scratch. It gives a very basic idea of what going on inside a Linear Regression model. 
The data set used here is 2D only i.e. it contains only one feature vector along with output. 
The data set is generated using linear X-dependent relation with random numbers and stored in CVS file (data.csv)
To run linear_regression.py, keep the data.csv file in the same folder as linear_regression.py or put the file path
**The specialty of code is that it can animate the first 10 steps of regression. **
